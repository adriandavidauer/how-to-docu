# how to documentation

Here we show how to set up a simple documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
It includes:
- a simple example of a documentation including a sample python package that will be documented.
- a pipeline to make the documentation available as artifact (right now Gitlab Pages is not available in our Gitlab).
